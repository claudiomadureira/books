# About

This repo aims to share all the books I've read. I highly recommend them to any developer that wants to self improve. These books helped me see things through many different perspective that I could say there's not turning back from them. All of them has changed the way I think and face people, situation, problem, etc. This library is not only recommended by me, all of the books were recommended by persons I inspiremyself in. I hope these books help you the way they did to me.
